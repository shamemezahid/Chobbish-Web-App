One night I was joking to myself, What if a Full Screen WebView = Web App? Tadaaa! 
Before that, I kinda knew how WebViews work but never used one. The next morning I wake up thinking what if it actually is a thing? :thinking: 
Looked up the docs and found out it actually is a thing (almost)! :exploding_head: 
>  * https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview
>  * https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/webview/gettingstarted 

I Used a Google Site that me and my classmates already use to keep a record on our academic contents / study materials.

Figured out a different way of using a splash screen. And finally not gonna lie, kinda proud of the splash screen animations. :3  
It was a short and fun project.
