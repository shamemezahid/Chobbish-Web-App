# CHOBBISH Web App

One night I was joking to myself, What if a Full Screen WebView could be a Web App? Tadaaa! 
Before that, I kinda knew how [WebViews on Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview) worked but never used one. Also Never really worked on a webapp before. So basically I didn't know what I was joking about :-: The next morning I wake up thinking what if it actually is a thing? :thinking: 
Looked up the docs and found out it actually IS! (almost) :exploding_head:

I Used a [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/new) named [Chobbish](https://sites.google.com/view/24csedu) that me and my classmates already use to keep a record on our academic contents / study materials.
Figured out a different way of using a splash screen than I did before. And finally not gonna lie, kinda proud of that splash screen [animation](https://i.imgur.com/m1uhSNX.gif). :3  

It was a smoll and fun project. :relieved:
